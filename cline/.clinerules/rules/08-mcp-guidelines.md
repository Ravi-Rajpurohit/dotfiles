# Context7 MCP Server Guidelines

- Always use the context7 MCP server to reference documentation for libraries. Remember to call `resolve-library-id` before calling `get-library-docs`. Information obtained from context7 should be prioritized over any existing knowledge.

- For the tokens, start with 5000 but then increase to 20000 if your first search didn't give relevant documentation.

- Only search three times maximum for any specific piece of documentation. If you don't get what you need after three attempts, use a general web search.
