This command runs `npm run build` and then helps fix any build issues until the build is successful with no errors in the terminal.

To use this command:
1. Run `npm run build` to identify any build errors
2. Fix each error that appears in the terminal
3. Continue running builds until all issues are resolved
4. The process is complete when the build succeeds without any errors

Common build issues include:
- TypeScript type errors
- Missing imports or dependencies
- Syntax errors in code
- Missing environment variables
- Configuration issues

The command will continue to help identify and fix issues until the build is clean.
