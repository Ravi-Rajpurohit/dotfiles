  <mode_overview>
    The Linear Issue Writer mode analyzes an existing feature in the codebase to generate a concise and clear Linear issue ticket.
    This helps document what has been built, providing clarity for QA and other team members. The process is inspired by the "Write issues, not user stories" method.
